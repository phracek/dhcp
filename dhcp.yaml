    summary: Provides the ISC DHCP client daemon and dhclient-script
    description: >
            DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol which allows
            individual devices on an IP network to get their own network
            configuration information (IP address, subnetmask, broadcast address,
            etc.) from a DHCP server. The overall purpose of DHCP is to make it
            easier to administer a large network.

            This package provides the ISC DHCP client.
